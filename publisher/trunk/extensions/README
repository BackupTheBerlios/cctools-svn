This module collects sample extensions for the P6 architecture.
Information on writing extensions may be found in the `CC Developer Wiki`_.

Sample Extensions
=================

 The following samples are included with the P6 package.

minimal
-------

 An example of what may be accomplished with no additional Python code, 
 only ZCML declarations.  The minimal plugin adds metadata fields to the
 uploaded work.

extractor
---------

 Provides metadata extracted from files using libextractor_.  Demonstrates
 using `canonical metadata URIs`_ to provide metadata to P6 applications.
 Whether or not the application actually uses the metadata is not addressed 
 -- this extension just provides it blindly.

blogping
--------

 Demonstrates writing an extension with a configuration UI.  Allows the user
 to ping their blog when they publish a new piece of media.
