Compiling the SVN version
=========================

svn co https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/cctools/publisher/trunk ccpublisher

Dependencies
------------
   * ccPublisher relies on some external repositories, but pulls in those
     automagically for you. If you have an older copy of ccPublisher checked
     out, a simple SVN up should pull them in.
   * Install other dependencies however your system accomplishes this task.


Contributing
============

ccPublisher welcomes your contributions.

While many developers work on fixing bugs and creating new features, it
is worth strong emphasis that even non-programmers can help make
ccPublisher more powerful and successful. You probably already have an idea
of something you'd like to work on. If not, here are just a few ways you
can help: 

   * Pick a bug, fix it, and send in a patch ("diff -uNrp" or "cvs diff -up")
   * Choose a feature you want to see developed, and make it
   * If you speak a language in addition to English, work on your
     language's i18n file directory
   * Find a new bug and report it
   * Help answer questions for new people on IRC or the mailing lists
   * Write an article advocating ccPublisher 


SVN Access
==========

See http://wiki.creativecommons.org/SVN for how to access SVN,
including browsing SVN from a web client.

We give SVN write access out to people with proven interest in helping develop
the codebase.  Proving your interest is straightforward:  Make one 
contribution and then request access.


Patch Decisions
===============

Our motto for changes to the codebase is "Patch first, ask questions
later".  When someone has an idea, rather than endlessly debating it, we
encourage folks to go ahead and code something up (even prototypish).
This is then incorporated into the development branch of the code for
folks to try out, poke and prod, and tinker with.  We figure, the best
way to see if an idea fits is to try it on for size.


Coding Style
============

Please refer to the Coding Style Guidelines
(http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Coding_Style) if you have specific questions
on the style to use for code.  If reading style guidelines doesn't interest
you, just follow the general style of the surrounding code, so that it is at
least consistent.
