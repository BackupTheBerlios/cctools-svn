What is libfeedback?
--------------------

 libfeedback (LFB) is a Python_ library and a set of related tools which allow 
 developers to collect feedback and crash telemetry from users.  LFB provides
 a Roundup_ tracker template, a WSGI_ application for collecting information
 into the tracker and Python modules for catching exceptions in certain types 
 of applications (currently on wxPython_ based).

How can libfeedback be used?
----------------------------

 libfeedback can be used in two primary ways: to collect crash telemetry and
 to provide users with a way to communicate feature request and application
 ideas to the developers.  Both of these methods use the autoPost.py WSGI
 application, which takes a HTTP POST request and updates information in the 
 Roundup tracker, returning a URL to the caller which can be used to view
 the status of the issue. 

 The difference in two applications lies in the source of the information
 reported to autoPost.py.  In the case of user suggestions or feature 
 requests, it is anticipated that the information would be collected by 
 either a wizard or form.  In the case of crash telemetry, an exception
 handler would be connected to catch problems.  An exception handler for
 wxPython-based applications is included.

Next Steps
----------
 libfeedback is currently being integrated with ccPublisher_ which will
 undoubtedly provide more information on ideal usage.  You can find 
 (possibly) more information in the Wiki_.
